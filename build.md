# Build instructions
## Tools required
<br>Soldering Iron
<br>Solder
<br>Side cutters
<br>Wire strippers
<br>Small screw driver
## Software requirements.
<br>Arduino IDE
<br>Requires the use of the following Arduino library
<br><br>https://github.com/coryjfowler/MCP_CAN_lib
<br>If you have the ability to, burn the new Arduino nano bootloader to the board.
<br><br>Then program with can-receive-all sketch
